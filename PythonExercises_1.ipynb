        "Jeff Buckley was born on November 17, 1966, in Anaheim, California, from musical lineage. His mother, Mary Guibert, was a classically trained musician, and his father, Tim Buckley, was a well-known folk singer. Buckley, however, only met his father one time; the two spent a week together when Buckley was 8. hHs father died of a heroin overdose at age 28, less than a year after the pair's meeting. Buckley was close with his stepfather, Ron Moorhead, and he gave Buckley his first Led Zeppelin album, which would prove to be highly influential to the future musician.\n",
        "\n",
        "After performing in a handful of cover bands throughout high school, Buckley attended the Los Angeles Musicians Institute after his high school graduation. Over the next several years, he played various gigs and wrote songs, looking for direction. In 1990, he moved to New York City, where he eventually joined the band Gods and Monsters, featuring Gary Lucas, the former guitarist with Captain Beefheart. It wasn't long, though, before he left the group to embark upon a solo career. He found his home away from home in a tiny East Village café called Sin-é. Some of his performances were captured on a four-song EP titled Live at Sin-é, which was released in 1993.\n",
        "\n",
        "In early 1994, Buckley went out on his first solo tour of small venues in support of the live album, and in the summer of 1994, his first studio album, Grace, was released (on August 23, the same day he and his band began their European tour in Dublin, Ireland)."
